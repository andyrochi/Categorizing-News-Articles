# Categorizing Chinese News Articles from the Web

## Abstract
In this project, we explore the machine learning pipeline and utilize 3 different methods (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks) to do the following task: categorize Chinese news articles from the web, given the title and content, into one of the following categories:

1. 科技 (Technology)
2. 產經 (Business and Economy)
3. 娛樂 (Entertainment)
4. 運動 (Sports)
5. 社會 (Society)
6. 政治 (Politics)

The news articles are obtained from [CNA](https://www.cna.com.tw/).
We show that after proper data preprocessing, we can achieve a descent accuracy of at least 93% using any of the three models.
